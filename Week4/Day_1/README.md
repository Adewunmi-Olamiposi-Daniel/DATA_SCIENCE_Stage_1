DSWK4D1 – NumPy Arrays & Vectorization

DAY 1 – MONDAY, NOV 17

🧭 DSWK4 – NumPy & Pandas Foundations

📅 Week 4 in Progress (Mon, Nov 17 – Sun, Nov 22)

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT:

Today marked my introduction to NumPy, the foundational library for numerical computing in data science. I learned that NumPy arrays are fundamentally different from Python lists because they are designed for fast, vectorized mathematical operations.

Key concepts covered include:

Creating NumPy arrays from Python lists

Understanding array dimensions (1D vs 2D arrays)

Inspecting array properties such as:

.shape (rows and columns)

.ndim (number of dimensions)

.size (total elements)

.dtype (data type)

Vectorized operations (element-wise math without loops)

Universal functions (ufuncs) like sqrt, exp, and sin

Boolean indexing to filter data based on conditions

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS:

During this lesson, I:

Created both one-dimensional and two-dimensional NumPy arrays.

Inspected array structure and metadata using NumPy attributes.

Performed vectorized addition and scalar multiplication across arrays.

Applied NumPy universal functions to compute square roots, exponentials, and trigonometric values element-wise.

Solved a mini exercise by:

Calculating the sum of array elements

Scaling array values by a constant

Filtering values using boolean conditions

All operations were done without loops, reinforcing NumPy’s efficiency and expressive power.

💭 REFLECTION:

This lesson made it clear why NumPy is the backbone of data science and machine learning. Instead of thinking in terms of loops and step-by-step instructions, NumPy encourages thinking in terms of operations on entire datasets at once.

The biggest realization today was that:

NumPy arrays are mathematical objects, not just containers.

Vectorization leads to cleaner, faster, and more readable code.

Boolean indexing feels like asking questions directly to the data.

This shift in mindset, from procedural thinking to data-oriented thinking, is a major step forward in my journey. NumPy doesn’t just make code faster, it makes thinking clearer.

Week 4 officially feels like the transition from basic Python to professional data science tooling.
