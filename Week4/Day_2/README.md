🧠 **DSWK4D2 — NumPy Indexing, Slicing, Reshaping & Random Generation**

📅 **DAY 2 — TUESDAY, NOV 18**

Today’s focus was on working deeply with NumPy arrays through indexing, slicing, boolean filtering, reshaping, flattening, and generating random numbers. I learned how to extract specific elements, rows, and columns from arrays, transform array shapes to suit data analysis needs, and generate reproducible random data for testing and simulations.

📚 **WHAT I LEARNED:**

How indexing works in NumPy for both 1D and 2D arrays, including positive and negative indexing.

Slicing arrays to extract ranges of data using start, stop, and step syntax.

How 2D slicing works using rows and columns (row, column notation).

Boolean indexing to filter array elements based on conditions like greater than or less than a value.

Reshaping arrays using `.reshape(rows, columns)` without changing the data itself.

Flattening multidimensional arrays into 1D arrays using `.flatten()`.

Generating random numbers using NumPy’s random functions, including random integers and random matrices.

How NumPy operations are vectorized, making data manipulation faster and cleaner than traditional loops.

🧩 **PRACTICE CHALLENGES:**

1️⃣ Create a NumPy array of numbers 1–12, reshape it into a 3×4 matrix, and print:

* The first row
* The last column

2️⃣ Given a 1D array, use boolean indexing to print:

* All values greater than 6

3️⃣ Generate a 3×3 random array and inspect its shape and values.

💭 **REFLECTION:**

This lesson made NumPy feel powerful and practical. I now understand how data scientists manipulate large datasets efficiently without writing loops everywhere. Indexing and slicing felt confusing at first, but once I understood the row and column logic, everything clicked. Reshaping especially stood out because it shows how flexible data representation can be without changing the underlying values. This lesson definitely moved me closer to thinking in arrays instead of lists.
