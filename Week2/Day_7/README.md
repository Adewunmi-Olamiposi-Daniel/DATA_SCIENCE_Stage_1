DAY 7 – SUNDAY, NOV 9

🧭 DSWK2 – Python for Data Science (Error Handling & Reflection)

📅 Week 2 Complete (Mon, Dec 2 – Sun, Nov 9)

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT:

This week focused on consolidating my understanding of Python error handling and reflection on coding practices. I learned about:

try, except, else, finally for managing exceptions

Common exceptions (ValueError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError, KeyError, IndexError)

Raising exceptions intentionally for better control

Creating custom exceptions for clearer, program-specific errors

Best practices for writing robust and clean code

Reflecting on problem-solving skills, the role of AI in coding, and personal growth as a developer

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS:

Throughout the week, I:

Reviewed all previous error handling lessons and applied them in mini exercises

Completed multiple-choice quizzes to check understanding of exception handling

Implemented a safe_divide(a, b) function that handles multiple exceptions and always executes cleanup code

Reflected on personal challenges in coding and strategies to improve problem-solving skills

Practiced using AI as a coding partner while focusing on logic and debugging skills

💭 REFLECTION:

This week reinforced that coding is more about problem-solving than memorizing syntax. Key takeaways:

try-except blocks prevent programs from crashing, but else and finally give precise control over flow

Creating custom exceptions makes code clearer and easier to maintain

Reflection on past mistakes helps me grow as a data scientist

AI can assist with writing code, but my thinking and problem-solving remain the most valuable skills

I realized that consistent practice and reflection, combined with strategic use of AI, is the way to truly master Python. Coding is a dialogue between my mind, my code, and my tools, and each error is a lesson. 💪
