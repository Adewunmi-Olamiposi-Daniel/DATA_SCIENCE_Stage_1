🧠 DSWK2D5 — Error Handling (try, except, else, finally)

— DAY 5 — FRIDAY, NOV 7

I explored how to make programs handle mistakes gracefully instead of crashing.
Learned to anticipate and manage errors such as invalid inputs, division by zero, and out-of-range indexes.
Also learned to combine loops and exceptions to make code more flexible and user-friendly.

📚 WHAT I LEARNED:

How to use try and except to catch and handle specific errors.

How else runs only when no error occurs.

How finally executes regardless of whether there’s an error or not.

How to prevent crashes in user input–based programs.

The importance of clean and user-friendly feedback messages.


🧩 PRACTICE CHALLENGES:

1️⃣ DIVISION HANDLER

Create a program that:

Accepts two numbers (numerator and denominator).

Catches and handles:

ValueError → when input isn’t a number.

ZeroDivisionError → when the denominator is 0.

Prints success or failure messages accordingly.

2️⃣ LIST ACCESS GUARD

Create a list called Stock_items with three items: ["Real Estate", "Oil & Gas", "Agriculture"].

Ask the user for an index (0–2) and display the item.

Handle:

-Out-of-range index → print "That position doesn’t exist."

-Invalid input (like text) → print "Enter numbers only."

3️⃣ MINI QUIZ
Simulate a short quiz:

Ask the user: “What is 5% of the Facebook valuation?”

The correct answer is $69.6 Billion.

If the user enters the wrong number, display "Wrong! Do more work on the assignment."

If the user enters text, handle the error and print "Numbers only."

End the program when they get it right.

💭 REFLECTION

Error handling taught me how to make my programs more human , they no longer crash when mistakes happen.
It’s like giving my code a safety net that helps it recover, explain, and continue.
Now I understand how try–except–else–finally make programs more professional, reliable, and user-centered.
