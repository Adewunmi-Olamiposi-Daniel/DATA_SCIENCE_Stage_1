🧠 DSWK2D3 — FUNCTIONS: DEFINING, CALLING & RETURNING VALUES

📅 DAY 3 - WEDNESDAY, NOV 5

Today’s focus was on functions, how to define them, call them, pass arguments, and use return values.
We also learned about default parameters and scope (how variable visibility works inside vs. outside a function).

📚 WHAT I LEARNED:

How to create and call a function using the def keyword.

The difference between parameters (used when defining a function) and arguments (used when calling it).

How to use return to send results back from a function.

Default values allow functions to work even if the user doesn’t provide all arguments.

Scope means variables inside a function are local — they can’t be accessed outside unless returned.

Functions help in breaking code into reusable, modular, and easily testable pieces.

🧩 PRACTICE CHALLENGES:

1️⃣ Total Cost Calculator
Write a function that accepts prices of three items (via input) and calculates the total cost.
If the total is above ₦4000, apply a 10% discount before returning the final value.

2️⃣ CGPA Grading System (with Default Parameter)
Create a function that takes total grade points and number of subjects (default = 5).
Return the CGPA and print remarks (Excellent, Good, or Needs Improvement).

💭 REFLECTION:
Today’s lesson made me realize that functions are the backbone of clean programming.
They save time, make debugging easier, and help organize logic.
I used to write everything in one block, but now I see how dividing tasks into functions improves clarity, reusability, and control.
Understanding scope also taught me why some variables don’t “exist” outside the function — everything has its proper boundary.

✅ Status: Completed
📅 Next Lesson: Default Arguments, *args, and **kwargs (DSWK2D4 — Thursday, Nov 6)
