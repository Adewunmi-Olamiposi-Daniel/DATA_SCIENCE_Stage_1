🧠 DSWK2D4 — DEFAULT ARGUMENTS, *ARGS, AND **KWARGS

📅 DAY 4 — THURSDAY, NOV 6

Today’s focus was on making functions flexible and reusable by learning how to handle varying numbers of inputs using default arguments, *args, and **kwargs.

📚 WHAT I LEARNED:

Default arguments allow functions to have preset values that can be used when no specific value is provided.

*args (Arbitrary Arguments) collect multiple positional arguments into a tuple — useful when the number of inputs is unknown.

**kwargs (Keyword Arguments) collect multiple key-value pairs into a dictionary — useful for passing flexible information.

Functions can mix these in order:
👉 parameters → *args → **kwargs

Real-world use: they help make programs scalable — like data entry forms or API functions where the input may vary.

🧩 PRACTICE CHALLENGES

1️⃣ Total Cost Calculator using *args

Write a function that accepts any number of item prices and returns their total.

2️⃣ Student Profile using **kwargs

Create a function that accepts flexible student details and prints them in a formatted profile.

💭 REFLECTION

Today’s class showed how *args and **kwargs make functions smarter and more adaptive.
Instead of rewriting code for every small variation, I can now pass as many arguments as I need — positional or keyword — and my function handles it dynamically.
Default arguments add extra safety, letting functions run even when some values are missing.
This is the essence of modular programming: flexibility + readability + reusability.
