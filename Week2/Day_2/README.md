🧠 DSWK2D2 — NESTED LOOPS & CONTROL STATEMENTS

— DAY 2 - TUESDAY, NOV 4

I explored how loops can control other loops and how special keywords like break, continue, and pass help manage program flow logically.
This lesson deepened my understanding of how Python makes decisions inside loops — just like humans follow step-by-step choices when solving problems.

📚 WHAT I LEARNED:

How nested loops work — a loop inside another loop (great for grids, tables, and complex iterations).

The role of break in stopping a loop immediately when a condition is met.

The use of continue to skip certain iterations (e.g., ignore odd numbers).

The placeholder pass statement for future or empty logic.

How control flow mirrors real-world decision-making: “If this happens, stop; if not, try again.”

🧩 PRACTICE CHALLENGES:

1️⃣ MULTIPLICATION GRID
Create a nested loop that prints a 5×5 multiplication table neatly formatted.

2️⃣ SKIP ODD NUMBERS
Use a for loop and the continue statement to print only even numbers from 1 to 10.

3️⃣ PASSWORD LOGIN SYSTEM
Build a login simulation where the user has 3 attempts to enter the correct password.
If successful, print “Access Granted✅”; if not, print “Account Locked❌.”

💭 REFLECTION:
Today’s lesson showed me that control statements make loops intelligent.
They don’t just repeat — they decide when to stop, what to skip, and what to ignore.
It felt like building a mini logic machine, where each command shapes how the program behaves.
Nested loops also helped me understand how complex data structures like tables and matrices are formed in programming.
