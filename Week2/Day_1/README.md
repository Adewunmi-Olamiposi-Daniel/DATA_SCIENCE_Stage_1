# 🧠DSWK2D1-*LOOPS — `FOR` & `WHILE` LOOPS

— DAY 1 - MONDAY, NOV 3)


I explored how to make Python repeat tasks automatically using loops.  
Learned to iterate over **lists**, **ranges**, and **strings**, and how loops mimic real-world repetition.

📚 WHAT I LEARNED:
- How to use `for` loops when I already know how many times I want to repeat something.
- 
- How to use `while` loops when the number of repetitions depends on a condition.
- 
- The concept of **iteration** — doing the same thing multiple times until a goal is reached.
-  
- Real-world connection: loops are like daily routines or countdowns — repeated until something happens
- .  
- Difference between:
- 
  - `for` → definite repetition
  - 
  - `while` → condition-based repetition

🧩 PRACTICE CHALLENGE:


1️⃣ COUNTDOWN TIMER.

Create a program that counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints **"Time's up!" 


---


2️⃣ MULTIPLICATION TABLE GENERATOR.

Ask the user for a number and display its multiplication table from 1 to 12.  

---

3️⃣ REVERSE MULTIPLICATION TABLE. 

Ask the user for a number and display its multiplication table from 12 down to 1.  

---

4️⃣ PASSWORD CHECKER.  
Keep asking the user to enter a password until they type the correct one (e.g., "python123").  
When they get it right, print **"Access Granted!"**

💭 Reflection
Today’s lesson helped me understand how loops bring efficiency to code.  
They let me automate tasks that would otherwise take hundreds of lines.  
At first, I struggled to see when to use `for` vs `while`, but now I know that it depends on whether I know how many repetitions I need.  
Loops make coding feel more like solving puzzles — smart, simple, and powerful.
