DSWK3D4-Utility-Functions

DAY 4 – THURSDAY, NOV 13

🧭 DSWK3 – Working with Files and Modules

📅 Week 3 — Day 4

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT

Today focused on creating reusable functions and organizing them into a custom Python module (utils.py). I learned how to:

Write helper functions like add(), substract(), greet_user()

Build a module that can be imported across scripts

Import either the whole module or specific functions

Create a function to sum numeric columns in a CSV (total_column)

This lesson teaches how to structure Python code professionally, making it reusable, maintainable, and modular.

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS

Throughout today’s lesson, I:

Created utils.py containing multiple helper functions

Imported the module in another script and called the functions

Practiced both importing the full module and importing specific functions

Built a total_column() function to calculate totals from CSV numeric columns

Ran the total_column() function on my Expenses.csv file to verify results

This practice helped me understand how modular code saves time and prevents repetition.

💭 REFLECTION

Today showed me the power of modular programming. Instead of rewriting code, I can now create functions once and reuse them anywhere.

Using utils.py made my code cleaner, easier to read, and easier to maintain. Functions like total_column() also introduced me to real-world data handling, preparing me for bigger projects like data analysis pipelines.

This lesson reinforced that organization is just as important as logic in programming.
