🧭 DSWK3 – Working with Files and Modules

📅 Week 3 Begins (Mon, Nov 10 – Sat, Nov 15)

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT TODAY

Today introduced me to file handling in Python, a core skill every data scientist needs because almost all real-world data is stored in files. I learned how to work with text files, from creating new ones to updating existing ones.

Specifically, I learned:

How to open a file using open(path, mode)

The 3 main modes:

"w" write mode (creates or overwrites a file)

"a" append mode (adds new data at the end)

"r" read mode (opens a file for reading)

How to write text into a file

How to append new content without deleting old content

How to read everything inside a file using .read()

How to handle multiline text using triple quotes

Why context managers (with open(...) as f:) are the safest and most professional way to work with files

This was my first step into understanding how Python interacts with the real world through storage.

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS

Throughout today’s lesson, I:

Created a text file and wrote an introduction about myself into it

Appended extra sentences to the same file using "a"

Used a context manager to add additional lines in a clean, safe way

Read the file back into Python and printed its full contents

Wrote a multiline message using triple-quoted strings

Confirmed my updates by printing the final version of the file again

All these steps showed me how flexible, powerful and simple Python file operations can be.

💭 REFLECTION

Working with files felt like opening a direct door to the outside world. Instead of everything happening inside Python, I finally interacted with real storage. It made the code feel more alive, like something that remembered what I wrote.

The biggest lesson today is that file handling is not complicated. It is mostly about understanding the mode you are using and knowing when to use a context manager.

This skill will be important later when I start handling CSV data, logs, datasets and automation tasks. Today was just text files, but it already feels like building the foundation for real data projects.
