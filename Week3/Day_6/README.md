DSWK3D6 — Mini Project: CLI Expense Tracker

DAY 6 — SATURDAY, NOV 15

🧭 DSWK3 — Working with Files and Modules

📅 Week 3 — Day 6: Mini Project

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT:

This lesson focused on combining everything from the week to build a simple command-line expense tracker:

Using CSV files to store data persistently

Writing reusable functions for add, view, and total operations

Handling dates with datetime for timestamps

Using os.path to check file existence and avoid duplicate headers

Reading, writing, and iterating CSV data with proper error handling

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS:

Throughout the lesson, I:

Built add_expense() to capture user inputs and save them in CSV

Developed view_expense() to list all expenses neatly

Created calculate_total() to sum all amounts in the CSV safely

Tested edge cases like missing files, invalid inputs, and formatting

Ensured the CLI menu loop works with exit and input validation

💭 REFLECTION:

This mini project tied together the week’s skills: file handling, modules, CSV manipulation, and functions. I realized that building a small tool like this reinforces the importance of:

Structuring code with functions for clarity and reuse

Validating user input to avoid crashes

Thinking ahead for file handling edge cases

Combining Python modules (csv, datetime, os) effectively

By the end, I had a working CLI expense tracker that could be extended further with features like filtering by date or category. It felt rewarding to see all the lessons from the week come together into a functional project. 💪
