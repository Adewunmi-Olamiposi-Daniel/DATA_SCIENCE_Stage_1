DSWK3D7 — Review & GitHub Push

DAY 7 — SUNDAY, NOV 16

🧭 DSWK3 — Working with Files, Modules & Mini Projects

📅 Week 3 Complete (Nov 10 – Nov 16)

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT:

This week focused on practical file handling, module usage, and small CLI projects. Key takeaways include:

Reading and writing text files and CSV files using Python’s built-in file handling and csv module.

Using standard libraries (os, math, datetime, random) for file paths, numeric operations, dates, and randomness.

Writing reusable utility functions in utils.py and importing them into other scripts.

Building a simple CLI expense tracker project combining file handling, CSV management, and datetime functionality.

Implementing the if __name__ == "__main__": guard to control script execution when importing modules.

Organizing code cleanly, handling errors, and preparing scripts for sharing via GitHub.

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS:

Created and appended to text files with context managers (with open(...)).

Read and wrote CSV files using both csv.writer and csv.DictWriter.

Explored math and OS operations, and practiced generating random numbers and shuffling lists.

Built a fully functional CLI expense tracker with add, view, and total features.

Used if __name__ == "__main__": guard to make the CLI tracker safely importable.

Reviewed all weekly scripts, debugged, and pushed code to GitHub.

💭 REFLECTION:

This week reinforced the importance of modular coding and safe script execution. Writing reusable functions and handling files properly makes scripts more maintainable and shareable. The CLI project tied everything together, showing how file handling, CSV management, and utility functions can form a small but functional Python application.
