DSWK3D2-CSV-Handling

DAY 2, WEEK 3, TUESDAY NOV 11

🧭 DSWK3 – Working with Files and Modules

📅 Week 3 — Day 2

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT TODAY

Today focused on CSV files, a core format for storing structured data in Python. I learned how to read, write, and manipulate CSVs using Python’s built-in csv module.

Specifically, I covered:

What CSV files are and why they are used in real-world data

How to read CSV files using csv.reader

How to read CSV files with headers using csv.DictReader

How to write CSV files using csv.writer

How to write CSV files with headers using csv.DictWriter

This knowledge is crucial for working with datasets in data science and business analytics.

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS

Throughout today’s lesson, I:

Created a CSV file updated_grade.csv using lists

Created a CSV file updated_company_list.csv using dictionaries for better clarity and maintainability

Built a mini project CSV file Expenses.csv with columns Date, Categories, and Amount

Practiced writing multiple rows and ensuring headers match data

Prepared data ready for reading, calculating totals, or performing further analysis

💭 REFLECTION

Today taught me that CSV files are the gateway between Python and real-world data. Unlike text files, CSVs give structure to data, making it easier to analyze, calculate, and report.

Using dictionaries to write CSVs feels more professional and safer because the keys explicitly map to headers. This reduces mistakes and makes future automation easier.

This lesson also showed that handling data is not just about storing it, it’s about preparing it so it can be used efficiently in Python scripts, dashboards, or even machine learning pipelines. And it gave me my first taste of data construction.
