🧭 DSWK3 – Working with Files and Modules

📅 Week 3 Continues (Mon, Nov 10 – Sat, Nov 15)

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT TODAY

Today introduced me to two essential Python standard libraries that power a lot of real world automation: the os module and the math module. These two tools help Python step outside simple scripts and start interacting with the system and performing advanced numeric operations.

Here is what I learned:

How to import built-in modules like os, math, and csv

How to check if a folder exists using os.path.exists

How to create a new folder with os.mkdir when needed

How to list all files inside any directory using os.listdir

How to build safe file paths with os.path.join

How to use math functions such as:

sqrt() for square roots

ceil() for rounding up

floor() for rounding down

factorial() for computing n!

How to read numbers from a CSV file and apply math functions to them

This lesson strengthened my understanding of how Python interacts with the computer's environment while also performing powerful mathematical operations.

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS

During today’s session, I:

Listed all files inside a folder named "MyFolder"

Used the csv module to read a file called "numbers.csv"

Converted each value in the CSV from text to integer

Printed out each number, its square root, and its factorial

Combined os, math, and csv in a single workflow that mimics real world data processing

This made me see how Python can move through directories, open files, interpret data and compute values all in one clean script.

💭 REFLECTION

Today’s lesson felt like stepping into a more powerful stage of programming. Instead of just writing code in isolation, I started interacting with the actual file system and performing meaningful calculations.

The os module showed me how Python can manage folders and files just like a human would. The math module reminded me that Python saves time by having ready made functions for complex operations.

Altogether, the lesson made me realize how these standard libraries form the backbone of automation, data preparation and machine learning workflows. It felt like unlocking a new tier of programming ability and understanding how Python connects to the real world.
