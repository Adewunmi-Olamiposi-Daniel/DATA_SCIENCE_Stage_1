DSWK3D5-Datetime-and-Random-Modules

DAY 5 – FRIDAY, NOV 14

🧭 DSWK3 – Working with Files and Modules

📅 Week 3 — Day 5

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT

Today focused on working with dates, times, and randomness in Python. I learned how to:

Use the datetime module to get current date and time, and calculate differences between dates

Access date.today() for just the date

Use timedelta to compute days until a specific event

Use the random module to generate random numbers

Randomly pick items from a list and shuffle lists

Build a mini dice game using random numbers and loops

This lesson reinforced handling both time-based calculations and simulated randomness, which are widely used in games, simulations, and scheduling tasks.

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS

Throughout today’s lesson, I:

Printed the current date and time using datetime.now()

Calculated days until Christmas using date subtraction

Generated random integers and choices from lists

Shuffled a list of numbers to simulate randomness

Built a mini dice game (“Rolling the Deck”) with input, conditions, and win/lose logic

Handled user decisions on continuing or stopping the game

💭 REFLECTION

Today taught me that Python’s built-in modules like datetime and random are powerful tools that simplify common tasks.

Datetime makes date arithmetic and countdowns effortless.

Random allows me to simulate games, selections, and unpredictability.

Combining these with loops and conditional logic makes for practical real-world scripts, like mini-games or event trackers.

I also learned the importance of control flow and input validation, especially in interactive programs like the dice game.
