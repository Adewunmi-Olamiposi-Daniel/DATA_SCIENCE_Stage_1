# Data_science_wk1d1
🗓️ DAY 1 — MONDAY, OCT 27

Goal: Environment setup & Python introduction

💻 WHAT I DID

Installed and configured Python (via VS Code / Colab).

Wrote my first Python program using print() and comments.

Explored variables and data types on W3Schools.

⚙️ TOOLS

Platform: Google Colab

Editor: VS Code (backup)

Repository: GitHub


💡 MY FIRST IMPERRESION

Python feels clean and beginner friendly. I like that indentation replaces curly braces, it forces me to write readable code.
I learned how to print text, handle simple variables, and write basic comments.
At first, I was nervous about setup, but seeing that first print("Hello, Data Science World!") line work felt exciting, like I just unlocked a new world.


🧠 REFLECTION SUMMARY

Today reminded me that big goals start small. I learned not to overthink — just run the code, see what happens, and learn from it.
I’m building consistency, not perfection.
