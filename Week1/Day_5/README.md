DSWK1D5-  DICTIONARIES & SETS.

🗓️ DAY 5 — FRIDAY, OCT 30


WHAT I LEARNED:

Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, making them ideal for quick lookups and structured data representation.

Sets store unique elements, automatically removing duplicates and helping identify distinct values in data.

Learned to add, remove, and loop through dictionary keys and values.

Understood how sets are useful for operations like eliminating duplicates, comparisons, and membership checks.

MY PRACTICE:

Created two programs:

A friend–subject tracker using a dictionary and a set to show unique subjects.

A dynamic input system that collects names and favorite data science tools, displaying unique tools mentioned.


REFLECTION:

Today’s lesson clarified the distinction between structured mapping (dictionaries) and unique data representation (sets).
Dictionaries are powerful when relationships between items matter (e.g., names to tools), while sets shine when uniqueness is key (e.g., distinct tools or values).
In real-world data science, dictionaries can map IDs to records or features, while sets can efficiently filter out duplicates or identify overlaps.
Understanding when to use each improves data cleaning, processing speed, and memory efficiency.
