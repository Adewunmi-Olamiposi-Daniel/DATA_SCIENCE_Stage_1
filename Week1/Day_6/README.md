# DSWK1D6-Conditionals-Logical-Thinking

📅 DAY 6 – SATURDAY, NOV 1

WHAT I LEARNED:

How to use if, elif, and else statements to control program flow.

Understood Boolean operators (and, or, not) and how they help with decision-making.

Learned how to validate user input before running logic (“guard clause” principle).

Saw how logic in programming mimics real-world reasoning but is far more structured and precise.

MY PRACTICE:

Created a grading system that evaluates three subjects — Python, Statistics, and Communication — and gives feedback based on performance.
Added input validation to ensure all scores are between 0 and 10.


REFLECTION:

Conditionals are the heart of logical reasoning in code. Humans make fuzzy judgments (“He did well enough”), but computers think in binary terms, True or False.
Understanding this difference helps write clean, predictable logic, which is crucial when automating decisions in data workflows (like filtering, thresholding, and classification).
