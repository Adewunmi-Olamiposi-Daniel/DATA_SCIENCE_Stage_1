🗓️ DAY 2 — TUESDAY, OCT 28

 PYTHON INPUTS & CONDITIONALS.

Today’s focus was on user input, data types, and conditional logic. I learned how to collect information from users using input(), convert them into the right data types (int, float, str), and make decisions using if, elif, and else.

For practice, I built a short program that asks for the user’s name, age, and CGPA, then classifies the CGPA into categories like excellent, very good, good, etc. It also predicts how old the user will be in five years.

WHAT I LEARNED:

How to properly format conditional statements.

The importance of indentation in Python.

How to handle both strings and numbers in input.


CHALLENGE COMPLETED:

✅ Bonus task — I added a rating system and future age prediction.

REFLECTION:
This was the first time I felt like I was talking to the computer, getting responses based on what I tell it. It’s simple, but it makes Python feel alive.# DSWK1D2
