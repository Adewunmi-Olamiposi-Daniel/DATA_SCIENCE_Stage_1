DAY 7 -SUNDAY, NOV 2


🧭 DSWK1 – Python Foundations for Data Science

📅 Week 1 Complete (Mon, Oct 27 – Sun, Nov 2)

🔹 WHAT I LEARNT:

This week built my foundation in Python, the core language of data science.
I learned about:

Variables & Data Types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)

Strings & f-strings for text formatting

Lists & Tuples for managing collections of data

Dictionaries & Sets for key-value relationships and uniqueness

Conditionals for logical decision-making (if, elif, else)

Proper use of input, slicing, loops, and type conversion

💻 MY PRACTICE HIGHLIGHTS:

Throughout the week, I:

Built a CGPA checker using f-strings and conditional logic.

Created an inventory management system using lists and tuples.

Designed a dictionary-based record system for friends and their favorite subjects.

Developed a grading and readiness evaluator using conditional statements.

Reinforced logic and debugging through small daily challenges.



💭REFLECTION:

This week taught me that coding is 70% logic and 30% syntax.
Understanding how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated is more important than just memorizing keywords.
Each data structure serves a purpose:

Lists for flexible data,

Tuples for fixed references,

Dictionaries for relationships, and

Sets for uniqueness.

Learning Python this way feels like understanding the language of data.
As the saying goes, "Data is power, and Data Scientists wield it." 💪
